            <p class="slideP-expanded">JW is a visual artist celebrated for his ability to transform the real into the abstract, creating artworks that challenge perceptions and invite viewers into a world of surreal beauty. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, JW's artistic journey began in the vibrant urban landscape, where he found inspiration in the contrasts and complexities of city life.
              <br><br>
              His early fascination with art led him to study at the Pratt Institute, where he developed her distinctive style that blurs the lines between reality and imagination. JW's work is characterized by a unique blend of vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and fluid forms that reinterpret everyday scenes and objects into abstract compositions. His keen eye for detail and masterful use of mixed media allow him to craft pieces that are both visually stunning and thought-provoking.</p>

            <p>Photography<br>Concert/Portrait<br>Latest Work: Awareness</p>
            <p class="slideP-expanded">Nova Liz is an emerging artist known for their multifaceted talents in photography and music. From a young age, they were deeply inspired by hardworking artists and their craft. Although they always aspired to immerse themselves in photography, music, and other artistic pursuits, they initially held back due to a fear of external criticism.
              <br><br>
              Nova's journey began at the age of 12 when they picked up a guitar. Despite their passion, they confined their playing to quiet moments alone at home. Their artistic aspirations took a significant turn when they moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, for two years. There, they found themselves surrounded by a community of creatives who encouraged them to take their talents seriously.
              <br><br>
              Since then, Nova Liz has flourished. They have photographed over 50 concerts and continue to add to that number. Their artistic journey has also led them to learn music production, and they dedicate themselves to playing and writing music daily.
              <br><br>
              Constantly inspired by the creatives around them, Nova strives to improve and grow as an artist. They firmly believe in the power of artists supporting one another, whether through photography, writing reviews, or collaborating on music. Their commitment to the arts is unwavering, as they devote every day to working on some form of creative expression. Nova Liz is a passionate and dedicated artist, deeply involved in the creative community and always eager to contribute and collaborate.</p>
